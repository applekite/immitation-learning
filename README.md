## 🌟 Overview
TSAC-DE is a project designed to create a safe reinforcement learning algorithm for autonomous driving. It works within the CARLA simulator, allowing for both experimentation and practical application. This project incorporates:

- A **spatio-temporal transformer encoder** that can process sequential driving data.
- **Deep ensemble critics** that provide reliable uncertainty estimates.
- A **trust score** that helps in making safe decisions.
- **Control barrier functions (CBFs)** to ensure all safety constraints are met.

## 📁 Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following main folders:

```
tsac-de/
├─ tsac_de/ # Core package (agents, models, safety, utils)
├─ configs/ # Experiment configs (YAML)
├─ carla/ # CARLA wrappers
```

### Core Package
This folder contains all main functionalities including agents, models, safety mechanisms, and utilities to support the safe reinforcement learning project.

### Experiment Configs
This folder holds configuration files in YAML format. These files define different experiment setups, making it easy to adjust parameters for testing.

### CARLA Wrappers
This is where you will find wrappers for the CARLA simulator, enabling smooth interaction between our models and the simulation environment.
